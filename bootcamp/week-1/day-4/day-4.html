       On Day 4, we discuss the fundamentals of objects and arrays as complex datatypes. We go over how to create, 
       access, modify, and delete data in these data structures. At the end of the lecture we will discuss two important topics:
       <ul>
        <li class="basic-text">
          Studies Project: At the end of the lecture, I will demonstrate how to create something called the studies project and 
          I will go over what it entails and how to complete it successfully.

        <li class="basic-text">
          Presentations: Next week students will be giving 3 minute lectures. Review the links the homework tab of your google 
          calendar schedule for more information.

        When you come to the point in the lecture when students are prompted to fork the Studies github repo, use the link above. This
        project does not have to be complete until the end of the course, but follow the instructions in the video closely to ensure
        you complete the project according the specifications.

        Once you have finished the class recording, open your scratch-pad workspace in stackblitz. Open your scratch-pad/day-4
        directory and complete the following work:
        <ul>
          <li class="basic-text">Complete all prompts in contact-list.js</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p class="basic-text">
        As with the work you completed yesterday, you want to frequently check the tests by opening the index.html file located in the 
        scratch-pad/day-2 directory with live server.
