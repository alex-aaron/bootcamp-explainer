        <h5 class="header-text">Introduction to the Asynchronous Bootcamp</h5>
        <p class="basic-text">Welcome to your first day of Bootcamp! If you are reading this, that means you have elected to take 
          the asynchronous version of our Bootcamp course. As someone who is taking the course "asynchronously", you are <b>not required</b> 
          to attend any of the virtual lectures. In essence, you are learning and internalizing the material on your own schedule, but you are 
          still expected to complete your coursework on the same schedule as the synchronous students. Follow the instructions in this
          explainer closely to ensure you complete every requirement.

      <p class="basic-text">
        The first thing you should do any given day is watch the class recording. These recordings will not only include all relevant lecture
        material, but they will also contain vital information regarding scheduling, attendance, and core Bootcamp expectations.
      </p>

      <p class='basic-text'>The lecture linked above will detail imporant course information. In addition, these key concepts will be introduced:
        <ul>
          <li class="basic-text">Pseudocoding</li>
          <li class="basic-text">Breaking down a function's inputs, outputs, constraints, and edge cases (IOCE)</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p class="basic-text">
        Complete the practice problems in this <a href="https://jsbin.com/jegawok/edit?js,console">JSBIN</a> when you reach the point in the lecture
        where students are practicing Pseudocoding and IOCE.

      <h5 class="header-text">Step Two: Fork Scratchpad Repository <a href="https://github.com/alex-aaron/scratch-pad.github.io">HERE</a></h5>
      <p class="basic-text">
        As you are watching the class recording linked above, at some point the instructor will prompt students to fork the "scratch-pad" repository.
        Use the link provided for Step Two to follow the class recording instructions yourself and fork this repo as the video describes. This step 
        is critical. The "scratch-pad" repository is where you will complete all of your week for week 1. Contact your instructor immediately if any of
        the steps outlined in the class recording do not work as expected. 
      </p>

      <p class="basic-text">
        Once you have successfully forked "scratch-pad", you should be able open the repo in stackblitz.

      <h5 class="header-text">Step Three: Complete Your Work</h5>
      <p class="basic-text">
        Once you open the scratch-pad repo in stackblitz, you will notice that it has 4 directories labeled "day-1", "day-2", "day-3", and "day-4".
        For your first day of bootcamp, you only need to worry about completing the prompts in the "day-1" directory. If you open the "day-1" folder, 
        you should this structure:
      </p>
      <img src="/images/day-1.png">
      <div class="screenshot">
        <p class="basic-text">
          Start with the `stringy.js` file. In this file, you will be prompted to solve functions dealing with string concepts. For every function, make
          sure you <b>breakdown the IOCE</b> as demonstrated in the class recording. In addition, make sure you are taking time to <b>pseudocode</b>. You need to be
          building these skills so now so they feel like second nature later. 
        </p>

        <p class="basic-text">
          As you are working on your functions, you should be checking your tests frequently. Do this by right clicking the `index.html` file in the "day-1" folder
          and selecting "Open with Live Server" or "Open with Five Server":
