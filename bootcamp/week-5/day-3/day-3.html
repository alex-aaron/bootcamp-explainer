      <p class="basic-text">
        To take the practice exam, begin by forking this <a href="https://github.com/alex-aaron/practice-exam-quebec">GITHUB REPO</a>. Once the repo is 
        forked, open it in Stackblitz. 

        The instructions for each prompt in this practice exam are located in the README.MD file. From there, you should add your solution code to the 
        index.js file. Finally, you can check if you are passing the tests by previewing the index.html file with Live Server. Give yourself no longer than
        2 hours to take this practice exam to time yourself in preparation for the actual exit exam.
