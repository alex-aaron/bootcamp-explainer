      <p class="basic-text">
        Once you install this project, you will notice it contains 4 directories: "chapter-2", "chapter-3", "chapter-4", "chapter-5". For this week, you 
        only need to worry about "chapter-2". If you open the "chapter-2" directory, you will see a <b>exercises.js</b> file. For homework, begin working
        on the exercises in this file. Each exercise has instructions listed above the function, but feel free to reach out if you have questions.
      </p>

      <p class="basic-text">
        This project is connected to the "Eloquent JavaScript" textbook, which can be accessed online at <a href="eloquentjavascript.net">eloquentjavascript.net</a>.
        Read Chapter 2 in its entirety before attempting the exercises. Each exercise is described in the "exercises" section at the end of the chapter, but use
        the instruction in your Eloquent JavaScript repository because the requirements there sometimes differ from what is in the textbook. That being said, feel
        free to use the hints provided in the textbook.
